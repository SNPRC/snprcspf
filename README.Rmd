# snprcspf -- Version `r snprcspf::get_version()`

## Disabled Excel File Formating
As of 2019 May 26, Java 12 has a bug \url{https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8221530}
that prevents the use of the XLConnect package. This version of snprcspf has removed that 
dependency with the side effect of not providing formating within the Excel workbook 
generated.
